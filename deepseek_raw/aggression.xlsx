Text:    I am confused as to how I could have been bloked for Vandalisim. I have never vandilized anyones work. I hae edited pages because the original authors have put in factual errors or I have added things and sourced them. I edited the PIRA article, because Jdorney continues to revert it back to the un-factual article he orginally wrote. If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.Another ridiculous complaint was made by SWATJester about the SAD article. The original SAD article was missing some facts, so I put facts from sources like Time Magazine, LA Times, Newsweek, and the New Yorkerin. But I did not delete any of his work, I merely added to it...so I don't know whyu the guy is throwing such a little hissy fit. I have the right to edit just like everyone else, as long as I source my edits (which I always do). If people disagree with my edits, they can tell me in a grown-up professional way, or they can re-edit the article. I am more then willing to work with people on Wikipedia, but to be blocked for bogus reasons is a disgrace. I have obeyed the rules of Wikipedia, if I am doing something wrong, send me a message, and I will adress that. But I will not stop contributing to articles, that is the whole point of Wikipedia, if it bothers some editors like SWATJeaster and Jdorney...well, that's too bad, they need to get over themselves, and either fact check their articles, or make it so nobody can change them. It amazes me that these two are so petty that they block someone for doing the same things they do...pathetic.","   I am confused as to how I could have been bloked for Vandalisim.

So, to make it more accurate, the paragraph describing her should say that she did not appear again until Duck Edwing and Bob Clarke took over the strip. If you look through BOTH Spy vs Spy compilations (The Complete Casebook and 2: The Joke And Dagger Files), one can clearly see that Peter Kuper was NOT the first successor of Prohias to bring the Grey Spy back.

Text: G: Gigi, R: RespondentThe key questions and answers are bold. The answers underlined are some interesting findings.Interviewee 1 (Female, 20)G: Please tell me which faculty you are in.R: Okay. I am in the faculty of business and economics.G: Have you ever had any sports drinks?R: Yes, I had.G: How often do you have sports drinks?R: Not very often. I have plenty of choices for drinks.G: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?R: Well… There’re no particular occasions that I would have sports drinks. I’ll have them whenever they come to my mind…like, when I’m studying or merely when I’m thirsty.G: Why do you think you would have sports drinks on those occasions, say when you are studying or when you are thirsty?R: I have sports drinks when I’m studying, because I believe that they could help to keep my spirits, so that I could concentrate on my studies. You know, your mind doesn’t function after reading the boring textbooks for a period of time. Having some sports drinks could get you freshen up.G: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.R: Pocari, Gatorade… I don’t know… Is Redbull a kind of sports drinks?G: No, it isn’t. Sports drinks are beverages that are intended to replenish nutrients, water, sugars and so on. Redbull is classified as an energy drink, as it is rich in sugars and caffeine.R: Oh, I see. So… what I know are Pocari and Gatorade.G: Okay. When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.R: Well…Sports drinks make me think of a charger. When your mobile phone or other electronic devices are out of battery, you got to use a charger and plug the devices to the socket. Sports drinks are like a charger for humans!G: Nice metaphor. Let’s come to the next question. What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?R: Well… I usually choose the brand I like. Favour is another criterion that I can think of. I usually choose the sports drinks with mints. Price is also something that I’ll pay attention to. You know. It’s just a drink and I don’t expect that it’s too expensive. G: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?R: Pocari, I guess.G: Why do you choose Pocari among all the other brands?R: Well… I already have a feeling that most sports drinks are very alike. Pocari is the first sports drinks that I have ever tried, so I don’t think I am going to switch to other brands very often. Pocari is also available for sale in many places, like the school campus. G: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?R: Mainly from ads. Sometimes, I may also purchase a certain brand of sports drinks because my friends say that it’s good.G: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?R: In the supermarket or the vending machines in the school campus or shopping malls.G: Please comment on the overall quality of Pocari.R: It’s quite nice. It’s quite refreshing and the price is reasonable…But it’d better if it has more favours, like Lemon-mint.G: Can you tell me how your perfect sports drink is?R: Well… A perfect sports drink should be quite nutritious and gives a refreshing feeling. It should have a wide range of favours…The price should also be reasonable.G: If your friends want to buy sports drinks, what advice would you give him/her?R: Pay attention to the nutritional values. Choose the ones that are more nutritious. Interviewee 2 (Female, 19)G: Please tell me which faculty you are in.R: I am from the faculty of Social Sciences.G: Have you ever had any sports drinks?R: Yes, I had.G: How often do you have sports drinks?R: Not very often. About once or twice per month.G: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?R: I usually have sports drinks after doing sports.G: How often do you engage in sports activities?R: About twice per week. I am a member of some sports teams. So, I engage in some regular practices for sports.G: But you said that you only have sports drinks about once or twice per month. So, what do you usually drink after doing sports?R: I usually drink water. You know, water is much cheaper.G: Do you think that sports drinks and water are equally good? R: Of course not. I suppose sports drinks can quench my thirst better than water. But, it would be quite costly to buy a bottle sports drink every time after doing sports. For water, I can simply get it from the canteen for free!G: Why do you think you would have sports drinks after doing sports?R: Well… Sports drinks are the best for quenching my thirst after doing sports. And From the ads, sports drinks are supposed to replenish nutrients and water quickly after doing sports activities.G: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.R: Redbull, Lucozade, Pocari, Gatorade.G: Which Lucozade do you refer to? R: The orange ones.G: Actually, Redbull and the Lucozade that you mentioned are energy drinks, instead of a sports drink. Sports drinks are beverages that are intended to replenish nutrients, water, sugars and so on.R: I see. G: When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.R: What I can think of are athletes, the Olympics and gold medals…that sort of things.G: What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?R: Favour is my main concern. I like some fruity favour, in particular. Price is also something that I will look at.G: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?R: Catorade.G: Why do you choose Catorade among all the other brands?R: Most of my friends say Catorade is the best. So, I just believe them and purchase Catorade. Of course, I did try a number of brands personally and find that Catorade is the best.G: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?R: From ads and from friends. G: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?R: Mostly in supermarkets.G: Please comment on the overall quality of Catorade.R: It has a wide range of favours. Grapefruit favour is my favourite. Other brands taste more or less the same. And I think Catorade can really quench my thirst efficiently after doing sports activities. In the past, some Catorade bottles got a mouthpiece that fits our mouth. Such design allows me to drink more easily when doing physical exercises. However, products with such bottles are no longer on sale in Hong Kong. I hope Catorade can resume to its old design, as it would suit the needs of athletes better.G: Can you tell me how your perfect sports drink is?R: It should quench my thirst pretty quickly after doing sports. It should also have good nutritional values…And good designs for the bottle as well…something that makes it easier to grip the bottle with my sweaty hands… Also, I hope the price would go down a little bit.G: If your friends want to buy sports drinks, what advice would you give him/her?R: Purchase those which are rich in water, nutrients and so on. Don’t just look at the favours. Interviewee 3 (Male, 20)G: Please tell me which faculty you are in.R: I am from the faculty of ArtsG: Have you ever had any sports drinks?R: Yes, I had.G: How often do you have sports drinks?R: About 3 times a month.G: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?R: Well… I have sports drinks when I’m having lunch…Sometimes during lectures.G: Why do you think you would have sports drinks during lunch or lectures?R: Well…I think sports drinks are a kind of soft drinks…I am used to have some soft drinks when having lunch or lectures. That’s my habit and I don’t know how to explain it.G: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.R: Gatorade, Pocari, Lucozade.G: Which Lucozade do you refer to? R: The orange ones. G: Actually, the orange Lucozade that you mentioned are energy drinks, instead of a sports drink. Sports drinks are beverages that are intended to replenish nutrients, water, sugars and so on.R: Oh, I see. I seldom see the silvery ones.G: When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.R: I can think of a nice shower. It’s equally refreshing as having a soft drink in the hot weather. I would also think of my favourite Soccer stars, like Rooney, Gerrard. Their images are consistent with sports drinks.G: What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?R: Favour. It’s the most important criterion for any types of drinks.G: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?R: Catorade.G: Why do you choose Catorade among all the other brands?R: Well… I switch to different soft drinks from time to time. I have tried a number of brands, and find that Catorade tastes the best.G: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?R: From ads. I go to supermarket sometimes and check if there’re any new products. G: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?NEW","G: Gigi, R: RespondentThe key questions and answers are bold. The answers underlined are some interesting findings.Interviewee 1 (Female, 20)G: Please tell me which faculty you are in.R: Okay. I am in the faculty of business and economics.G: Have you ever had any sports drinks?R: Yes, I had.G: How often do you have sports drinks?R: Not very often. I have plenty of choices for drinks.G: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?R: Well… There’re no particular occasions that I would have sports drinks. I’ll have them whenever they come to my mind…like, when I’m studying or merely when I’m thirsty.G: Why do you think you would have sports drinks on those occasions, say when you are studying or when you are thirsty?R: I have sports drinks when I’m studying, because I believe that they could help to keep my spirits, so that I could concentrate on my studies. You know, your mind doesn’t function after reading the boring textbooks for a period of time. Having some sports drinks could get you freshen up.G: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.R: Pocari, Gatorade… I don’t know… Is Redbull a kind of sports drinks?G: No, it isn’t. Sports drinks are beverages that are intended to replenish nutrients, water, sugars and so on. Redbull is classified as an energy drink, as it is rich in sugars and caffeine.R: Oh, I see. So… what I know are Pocari and Gatorade.G: Okay. When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.R: Well…Sports drinks make me think of a charger. When your mobile phone or other electronic devices are out of battery, you got to use a charger and plug the devices to the socket. Sports drinks are like a charger for humans!G: Nice metaphor. Let’s come to the next question. What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?R: Well… I usually choose the brand I like. Favour is another criterion that I can think of. I usually choose the sports drinks with mints. Price is also something that I’ll pay attention to. You know. It’s just a drink and I don’t expect that it’s too expensive. G: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?R: Pocari, I guess.G: Why do you choose Pocari among all the other brands?R: Well… I already have a feeling that most sports drinks are very alike. Pocari is the first sports drinks that I have ever tried, so I don’t think I am going to switch to other brands very often. Pocari is also available for sale in many places, like the school campus. G: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?R: Mainly from ads. Sometimes, I may also purchase a certain brand of sports drinks because my friends say that it’s good.G: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?R: In the supermarket or the vending machines in the school campus or shopping malls.G: Please comment on the overall quality of Pocari.R: It’s quite nice. It’s quite refreshing and the price is reasonable…But it’d better if it has more favours, like Lemon-mint.G: Can you tell me how your perfect sports drink is?R: Well… A perfect sports drink should be quite nutritious and gives a refreshing feeling. It should have a wide range of favours…The price should also be reasonable.G: If your friends want to buy sports drinks, what advice would you give him/her?R: Pay attention to the nutritional values. Choose the ones that are more nutritious.

About once or twice per month.G: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?R: I usually have sports drinks after doing sports.G: How often do you engage in sports activities?R: About twice per week. I am a member of some sports teams. So, I engage in some regular practices for sports.G: But you said that you only have sports drinks about once or twice per month. So, what do you usually drink after doing sports?R: I usually drink water. You know, water is much cheaper.G: Do you think that sports drinks and water are equally good? R: Of course not.

Text: Hazel Eye MythThe description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hazel_eye_of_a_mixed-ethnicity_female.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amber_Brown_Green.jpg  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:S7307583.jpg#.7B.7Bint:filedesc.7D.7Dhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HumanFemalewithAmberIris.jpghttp://toponthelist.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/amber_eye.jpg  http://www.flickr.com/photos/mocuishle_photography/2340845990/sizes/l/in/photostreamHere are some sources backing up my statement;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hazel (defines it as a light golden brown colour, after a hazelnut)http://www.wonderquest.com/eye-color-age.htm (states hazel eyes are light brown or yellowish brown) http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right) http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown (central heterochromia) under the green category) http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown) http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude)http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe)http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement)Hazel Eye Picture On The RightThe picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil).

Text: Rajarata was abundant due to regular wars for the Rajarata land. Sinhalese kings tried to re established Rajarata, but they weren't allowed by Pandyan empire. They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. So clear major reason is they were adjusted to a another system. Also non existence of expert knowledge to rebuild the system could help to not to go to dry zone again.  But clearly it is not enviornmental issues. It was run more than 15 centuries.I don't see Magha is irrelavant here. Magha doesn't mean only Magha. He couldn't do all the things alone. He was supported by his army.Even king didn't had child army had children. Those are the people who came to Jaffna.    pre History of Jaffna kingdom Jaffna was part of Rajarata before the collapse of Rajarata. Some people trying to say there was independent kingdom (convergence) Jaffna. But how there can be a kingdom without people ? People came with Magha's army. So due to what it could survive from the power of Rajarata ?    Starting point of Rajarata Magha is not the one who established Jaffna kingdom. Magha is the last king of Rajarata. People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. It is not right to say Magha as the establisher of Jaffna kingdom. He was the king of Pollonnaruwa but after his death and tamil forces was expelled from Rajarata core areas to Jaffna they were under protection of the Pandyan king.

Text: This is the armeniapedia version about the battleIn violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams.

(No, seriously, they have been rude and unfair, but for some weird reason you just don't see it anywhere with Jezz...even though he unquestionably violated WP, and has been uncivil and disrespectful and hypocritical...with lies and double standards.  He said I did not talk about the article itself (a lie) and only soapboxed him as if he never said anything negative about me in individual comments of his.  And he also said that I ignored ``Bold Revert Discuss`` when I have been discussing a great deal.::::I get your point that I re-inserted earlier on before discussing, but you're acting like not violating 3RR means absolutely nothing.   There's a balance, beecause I know that edit-warring can happen even without breaking 3RR, but it's not like I did not put big work and presentations and rationales on the article talk page, taking time and energy.   Totally unappreciated by Jezz (and apparently by you). You notice so-called uncivil remarks and behavior from me and nothing from Jezz, which makes me question your analysis to be honest.   He's been horrendous and you don't even seem to care or even admit it...or see it!   He wrote individual comments soapboxxing against me.  That goes un-addressed (accept by me).   And then he insanely accuses me of what he was blatantly himself guilty of doing.   Unbelievable.    `",aggressive,1,"[""aggressive""]","[""aggressive""]",,"[""aggressive""]"

God calls many men, both Jews and Gentiles, to the salvation that He has prepared in the death and resurrection of His Son. Many of those who are called by the preaching of the gospel refuse to come: ``and they would not come`` (v.3). Some do come to the marriage with the true faith that receives the wedding garment of the imputed righteousness of Christ. The reason for this twofold outcome of the call of God in the preaching of the gospel, Jesus gives in the concluding verse of the parable: ``For many are called, but few are chosen`` (v.14).There is a call of God by the preaching of the gospel to many more persons than those who have been elected. This call, however, is sharply distinguished from the call that God gives to the elect. The parable, thus, warns against hyper-Calvinism on the one hand, which tries to restrict the call to the chosen, and against Arminianism on the other hand, which denies any distinction between the call to the elect and the call to the reprobate.

Text: `:::I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters.

Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters.

Text: `:Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real ``edit conflict`` I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - ``A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.`` - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of ``Welsh nationality`` (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his ``explanation`` on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about myself and others as a result of his decision: I merely wish to give my side of what is otherwise a one-sided story, inevitably so given my absence from the discussion.   `","`:Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84.

No one in the mp3 is identified as being one of the Gaedes, or even a fan of their music.  Prussian Blue and the Gaedes are never mentioned in the mp3.

Re: Prussian Blue mp3 If you'd checked the talk page, you'd have seen that I've had a message for you there for a long time regarding the mp3 which I removed, and which you recently reinserted, and which has been removed once again.  Specifically, the mp3 does not have any material regarding Prussian Blue in it.  The interview is between a DJ at KERN radio and an 11 year old girl named ``Ellie Mae``.  While the mp3 does cover the topic of white nationalism and racism (as the little girl is obviously being coached by her parents on what to say).  No one in the mp3 is identified as being one of the Gaedes, or even a fan of their music.  Prussian Blue and the Gaedes are never mentioned in the mp3.  The mp3 therefore does not support the claim that Prussian Blue are ``just proud of their heritage``.  Cheers,   Please do not remove my header (shown below) from my talk page.

That’s why Pik gets a big gun called a 07N2 light machine gun. Pik gets an medium damage 45.0 damage per hit as well as good fire rate of 1220 rpm shot by 70.5 freefire muzzle velocity. To balance 07N2 is high recoil however recoiles can still be controlled despite recoil with clpical perks! To balance 07N2 continued, 07N2 also topped by 50 clip size of mags, simply dominant! While all buffs 07N2 is mediocre mag size and quite negative pelmy accuracy, accuracy of 42.0 of 07N2 are also depleted with inaccuracy of 30.0 and slightly inb accuracy of 9.0 worth of recoils. Funny enough , 07N2 is a moderate fast reload gun is pretty fast running framerate 250.0 run speed makes Pik’s weapon is easily fast to run around the map swiftly. Especially if Pik tries to run fullspeed, 07N2 can constantly fast running power of 250.0 gun speed. Dude every remarkable stats is not bad considering 07N2 is bad accuracy and mediocre mag size. But Pik is so happy to finally get good firepower weapon of 07N2. Pik can brjunuk power: definitely of 07N2’s uniformly recovered balance of weapons are sleek despite of any overwhelming down push offs in any foolishness bias aspects. Of course, variety in weapon is uncertain but Uniform crap is too not much applied to 07N2, thus 07N2 is a fair gun of predict thrust in uniformed alike gun of Battlefox. Another ty for cleaning GFF use it doesn’t get Pik

Text: `{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you ``admins`` tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as ``personal attacks`` or ``harassment`` when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly ``okay`` (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly ``okay`` for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ``ebaY`` logo to go next to the current one, ``ebay,`` in the lead, is ``because I wanted it in there,`` even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly ``not okay`` for me to call that kind of slander stupid?3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly ``okay`` for him and ``smiley girl`` there to falsely accuse my edits of being ``vandalism`` just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a ``personal attack`` just because I'm an IP-only editor?4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with ``Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',`` or ``Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' ``?5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that `` 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense``? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called ``consensus`` too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called ``consensus`` wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) ``consensus`` wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive ``consensus,`` do the same thing, it's ``edit-warring`` even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the ``being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense`` rule)?  `","`{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks.
